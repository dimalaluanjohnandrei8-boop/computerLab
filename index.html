    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        A computer is an electronic device that accepts raw data as input,
        processes it according to a set of instructions called programs,
        and produces meaningful information as output. In today’s modern world,
        computers play a very important role in our daily life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Computers work with great speed and accuracy. They can store a large
        amount of information and retrieve it whenever needed.
    </p>

    <h2>History of Computer</h2>
    <p>
        The history of computers began with simple calculating devices such as
        the abacus. Early computers were very large in size and used vacuum tubes.
        These computers consumed a lot of electricity and were very expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the invention of transistors, integrated circuits, and microprocessors,
        computers became smaller, faster, cheaper, and more powerful. Today,
        computers are portable and available to almost everyone.
